# Hi there 👋 I’m **Anandh Ajay**  

## 🎓 About Me  
- I’m currently pursuing a **B.Tech in Electronics & Communication Engineering**.  
- I’ve recently completed a mini-project on **Electric Vehicles (EV) charge monitoring & fire-protection systems**.  
- I’m developing my software-development skills, and I’m comfortable with **Python**, basics of **C**, and **SQL**.  
- I’m an **ambivert**, which helps me adapt to different environments.  
- I have a strong passion for sports — which has taught me resilience, perseverance, and a “never giving up” mindset.  
- I enjoy **organising events**, ensuring they run smoothly & efficiently.  

## 🛠️ What I’m Working On  
- My current focus: Building a **medical-assistant robot** — combining my ECE background with software development.  
- Expanding my skill-set in software development (exploring frameworks, algorithms, and system design).  
- Looking for opportunities (internships or collaborations) in embedded systems, robotics, EV systems, or software engineering.  

## 🚀 Technical Skills  
| Domain | Skills |
|--------|--------|
| Programming Languages | Python, C (basics), SQL |
| Electronics / Embedded Systems | EV charge monitoring, fire-protection systems |
| Robotics & Automation | Medical-assistant robot (in progress) |
| Soft Skills | Adaptability, event-organisation, perseverance, team collaboration |

## 📁 What You’ll Find Here  
- My personal & academic projects (EV systems, robotics, etc.).  
- Code experiments and learning repositories (software & firmware).  
- Possibly, future articles/tutorials about what I learn along the way.

## 📫 How to Reach Me  
- Feel free to open an issue or PR here if you’d like to discuss a collaboration.  
- Connect with me (you can add your preferred contact: email / LinkedIn / Twitter)  
- I’m open to mentorship, discussions and sharing ideas — let’s build something together!

## 🌱 Fun Facts  
- As a sport‐lover, I believe the same “never give up” attitude transfers into my projects and coding too.  
- Being an ambivert means I can work well in both team settings and quietly focus on code solo.  
- I love taking on new challenges — whether in technology, organising events or learning a new language.
